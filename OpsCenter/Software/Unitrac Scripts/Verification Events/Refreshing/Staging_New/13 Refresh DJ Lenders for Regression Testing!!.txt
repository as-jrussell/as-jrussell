Moving forward, the following lenders will be used by QA for all regression testing. 

For DJs: 

Georgia Heritage Federal Credit Union #1275 
\\vut-app\mountain\specs\1275_Georgia_Heritage_FCU (Correlation Keystone).djs



Hermantown Federal #1890

\\vut-app\eastern\specs\1890 Hermantown_FCU (MTG).djs



\\vut-app\eastern\specs\1890 Hermantown_FCU (VEH)_title.djs

 
For Custom DLLs: 
Credit Acceptance Corporation #5310 (for Vehicles) 
IBM Southeast Employees #2250 (for Mortgage)

We need to make sure, as part of the refresh, that the most recent DJ files for 1275 & 1890 are copied over from prod
 to the environment being refreshed and are re-mapped to that environment, as well.

Thanks!
