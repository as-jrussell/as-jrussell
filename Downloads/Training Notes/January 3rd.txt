ODEPT-133 : Training

Funny enough this dropped into my lap this morning as a first one. Unitrac Mass Queue Deleted job it seems that it did what it was supposed but didn't clear as intended. The only reason I am seeing that it didn't is due to the following error: 

UPDATE failed because the following SET options have incorrect settings: 'QUOTED_IDENTIFIER'. Verify that SET options are correct for use with indexed views and/or indexes on computed columns and/or filtered indexes and/or query notifications and/or XML data type methods and/or spatial index operations.


Upon investigation and I was able to login as that user and run it with not seeing the error but I did read through this thread to see this as a potential fix.
