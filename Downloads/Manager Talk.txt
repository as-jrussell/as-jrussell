Can you please reinforce that tickets should NOT be assigned directly to users over teams. Granted it that this is 
during the freeze but this could have a been an issue considering that I was out when this ticket was created and assigned.

I am sure Patience and Steve has mention how bad the Informatica DPM Project has become. 

AIH-9267 I have been working with Michael Poetz on this ticket and he's been helpful from a System Admin stand point but Rashid 
really has not been helpful at all. At one point he just said let's give everything read access but due to our rules that isn't
something we do with accounts. 

In most all my Production tickets I am placing a note that the "Due to the change freeze this work will be executed on or after January 3rd"


Title change I am noticing and it's been pretty prevelent that I have been doing the work as a Production DBA moreover the Developmental DBA
I know at one point we are going to move to Cloud DBA can we change that to Production DBA and also do I need approval to reach out to the
receptionist to have the reprint of the name tag..... maybe I am more of a Hybrid Prod/Developmental DBA 

During the last week of March or first week of April I will be taking a vacation.
