LONG DESCRIPTION
    Best Practices Analyzer (BPA) includes a set of Windows PowerShell cmdlets
    that allow you to scan some of the technologies (often called "models" in
    cmdlet Help) that are installed on your Windows operating system for
    compliance with best practices. You can use cmdlets to get a list of all
    models that are installed on the computer that can by scanned by using BPA,
    perform scans, and view, filter, or archive scan results.


HOW TO ACCESS BEST PRACTICES ANALYZER CMDLETS

    Before you can work with BPA cmdlets, you must import the BestPractices
    module into your Windows PowerShell session. Type the following cmdlet, and
    then press Enter.

    Import-Module BestPractices

    Importing the BestPractices module allows you to run the following cmdlets:

    Get-BPAModel
    Invoke-BPAModel
    Get-BPAResult
    Set-BPAResult


HOW TO VIEW INSTALLED BPA MODELS

    To view a list of installed models, type the following, and then press
    Enter.

    Get-BPAModel

    The Get-BPAModel cmdlet returns details about the BPA-supported models that
    are installed on the computer.

    For more information about Get-BPAModel, type the following, and then press
    Enter.

    Get-Help Get-BPAModel -full


HOW TO START A SCAN

    The output of the Get-BPAModel cmdlet shows model IDs for all BPA-supported
    models that are installed on the computer. Enter the model ID as part of the
    Invoke-BPAModel cmdlet to start a BPA scan on that model, as shown in the
    following example.

    Invoke-BPAModel -BestPracticesModelId <ID from output of Get-BPAModel>

    To scan all installed models at the same time, type the following, and then
    press Enter.

    Get-BPAModel | Invoke-BPAModel

    For more information about Invoke-BPAModel, type the following, and then
    press Enter.

    Get-Help Invoke-BPAModel -full


HOW TO VIEW AND FILTER RESULTS

    To get the results from the most recent BPA scan for a specific model, type
    the following, and then press Enter, in which Model Id represents the ID of
    the model for which you want to get scan results.

    Get-BPAResult <Model Id>

    Because you might not have to see some scan results, especially if you run
    frequent scans, you can use the Set-BPAResult cmdlet to exclude scan results
    that you do not want to see, or that are not relevant to your scan. Excluded
    scan results can be included again at any time.

    For more information about Set-BPAResult, type the following, and then press
    Enter.

    Get-Help Set-BPAResult -full


HOW TO ARCHIVE RESULTS

    You can archive the result of a BPA scan into an HTML-based report. Although
    a default cascading style sheet (CSS) is included with Best Practices
    Analyzer cmdlets to format BPA reports, you can specify another CSS to apply
    formatting to your report, if you prefer.

    The following is an example of how to archive results for a single model,
    applying the default CSS.

    Get-BPAResult -BestPracticesModelId <Model Id> | ConvertTo-Html -As List -
    CssUri
    $env:windir\system32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\Modules\BestPractices\BestPracti
    cesReportFormat.css > <path to HTML report file>

    The following is an example of how to archive results from the most recent
    BPA scans for all models, applying the default CSS.

    Get-BPAModels| Get-BPAResult | ConvertTo-Html -As List -CssUri
    $env:windir\system32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\Modules\BestPractices\BestPracti
    cesReportFormat.css > <path to HTML report file>
